# Wasmcompute Design

This is the design of wasmcompute. Each article focuses on a different
area of the project. This is still a work in progress so please give it time for the document to grow and update.

- [Web Server](./web_server.md)
- [Wasm Core](./wasmcore.md)
- [Wasmcompute cli](./cli.md)
- [Wasmcompute configuration file](./projectfile.md)
- [Wasmcompute library](./library.md)
- [Wasmcompute dependencies](./dependancies.md)

We also include documents to some of our examples projects that show off
the capabilities of wasmcompute. these projects are open source and
can be deployed by anyone. To view a list of them follow the link:
